Requirements (Windows/Linux/MacOS/BSD)

Using 666Merge
============
Clone this repo or just click on the green Code button and download the zip folder. Then just place 666merge.py into the directory containing your split PS3 game files and run it however you'd like.

Once you run the program, it will search through the directory it is located in, along with any subdirectories within it. If it finds any split PS3 game files, it will ask if you want to merge them. It will then merge the files if you choose to do so. If you'd rather not, the program will close and let you move on with your life.
